# Raspberry Pi Client Deployment

This directory contains the setup script for deploying and maintaining the Voice Assistant client on Raspberry Pi.

## üìÅ Directory Structure

```

## üöÄ One Script for Everything

The `setup.sh` script handles **everything**: initial installation, updates, and fixes. You can run it as many times as you want - it's completely idempotent.

### Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure:
- Hardware is wired correctly (see docs/HARDWARE.md)
- I2S is enabled in `/boot/firmware/config.txt`
- Server is deployed and accessible

### First Time Installation

```bash
# SSH to your Raspberry Pi
ssh user@raspberrypi.local
```

```bash
# Edit the config file
sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt

# Find this line (around the bottom):
#dtparam=i2s=on

# Remove the '#' to UNCOMMENT it, and add the overlay:
dtparam=i2s=on
dtoverlay=googlevoicehat-soundcard

# Save: Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X
```

```bash
# Clone the repository
cd /tmp
rm -rf javia
git clone https://github.com/shreyashguptas/javia.git
cd javia

# Run setup
bash pi_client/deploy/setup.sh
```

The script will:
- ‚úÖ Install system dependencies (PyAudio, gpiozero, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Create Python virtual environment
- ‚úÖ Copy client files to `~/javia_client`
- ‚úÖ Prompt for SERVER_URL and CLIENT_API_KEY (first time only)
- ‚úÖ Validate configuration
- ‚úÖ Create systemd service (Pi 5 compatible)
- ‚úÖ Add user to `audio` and `gpio` groups (required for hardware access)
- ‚úÖ Enable autostart on boot
- ‚úÖ Start the service and verify it's running

**If the service fails to start**, the script will:
- ‚ùå Show error logs explaining why
- üí° Provide troubleshooting steps
- üîÑ Allow you to fix and re-run the script

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT - Group Permissions**:
- The script requires you to be in `audio` and `gpio` groups
- If you're not in these groups, the script will add you and **EXIT**
- If you're assigned to the groups but they're not active in your current session, the script will **EXIT**
- **You MUST log out and log back in**, then run the script again
- The script will NOT start the service until group permissions are active

### Updating After Code Changes

When you make changes to the code on your Mac and push to GitHub:

```bash
# SSH to your Raspberry Pi
ssh user@raspberrypi.local
```

```bash
# Pull latest changes
cd /tmp/javia
git pull

# Run the SAME script again
bash pi_client/deploy/setup.sh
```

The script will:
- ‚úÖ Install any missing dependencies
- ‚úÖ Copy latest client files
- ‚úÖ Give you option to keep or update configuration
- ‚úÖ Update virtual environment
- ‚úÖ Restart the service

**It's that simple!** No need to remember which script to run - it's always the same one.

### Fixing Issues

If you encounter any issues (audio not working, service not starting, etc.), just run the setup script again:

```bash
cd /tmp/javia
bash pi_client/deploy/setup.sh
```

## ‚úÖ Verify Client is Working

After running the setup script, check if the client is running:

```bash
# Quick check - is the service running?
systemctl is-active voice-assistant-client.service && echo "‚úÖ Running!" || echo "‚ùå Not running"

# Detailed status
sudo systemctl status voice-assistant-client.service

# View live logs (press Ctrl+C to exit)
sudo journalctl -u voice-assistant-client.service -f
```

**If running successfully**, you'll see:
- Status: `active (running)`
- Log message: `[READY] System ready! Press button to start...`
- **You can now press your button and speak!**

**If not running**, check the logs for errors and re-run the setup script.

## üìù Quick Reference

### Important Paths

- **Installation directory**: `~/javia_client`
- **Virtual environment**: `~/venvs/pi_client`
- **Configuration**: `~/javia_client/.env`
- **Service file**: `/etc/systemd/system/voice-assistant-client.service`

### Common Commands

```bash
# View service status
sudo systemctl status voice-assistant-client.service

# View logs (live)
sudo journalctl -u voice-assistant-client.service -f

# View last 50 log lines
sudo journalctl -u voice-assistant-client.service -n 50

# Restart service
sudo systemctl restart voice-assistant-client.service

# Stop service
sudo systemctl stop voice-assistant-client.service

# Start service
sudo systemctl start voice-assistant-client.service

# Test manually (stop service first)
sudo systemctl stop voice-assistant-client.service
source ~/venvs/pi_client/bin/activate
cd ~/javia_client
python3 client.py
```

### Test Audio Hardware

```bash
# List audio devices
arecord -l
aplay -l

# Test recording (5 seconds)
arecord -D plughw:0,0 -c1 -r 48000 -f S16_LE -d 5 test.wav

# Test playback
aplay -D plughw:0,0 test.wav

# Check audio group membership
groups $USER
# Should include: audio gpio

# Check if beep files exist
ls -lh ~/javia/audio/*.wav
```

## üîë Configuration Management

When you run `setup.sh` on an already-configured system, it will:
1. Detect existing configuration
2. Ask if you want to keep it or enter new values
3. For updates, just choose option 1 to keep existing config

**To find your SERVER_API_KEY on the server:**
```bash
ssh user@your-server-ip
sudo cat /opt/javia/.env | grep SERVER_API_KEY
```

The CLIENT_API_KEY on the Pi must match the SERVER_API_KEY on the server.

## üîí Security Notes

- ‚úÖ `.env` file contains SERVER_URL and API key
- ‚úÖ File permissions set to 600 (owner read/write only)
- ‚úÖ Service runs as your user (not root)
- ‚úÖ API keys never committed to git
