# Authentication Note:
# CLIENT_API_KEY is no longer used. Authentication is now via device UUID.
# Each device has a unique UUID that must be registered on the server.
# The UUID is automatically generated on first boot and stored in ~/.javia_device_uuid
# To register your device, see the setup instructions or run on the server:
#   cd /opt/javia
#   ./register_device.sh <YOUR_DEVICE_UUID>

# Note: RECORD_SECONDS is not used - recording continues until you press the button again!

# Audio Settings:
# MICROPHONE_GAIN - Amplification factor applied on server (offloads processing from Pi)
#   1.0 = No amplification (RECOMMENDED - INMP441 naturally outputs 70-80% signal)
#   1.3 = 30% boost (use if your recordings are slightly quiet, reaches ~95%)
#   1.5 = 50% boost (only if speaking very quietly or mic far away)
#   2.0 = Double volume (likely to cause clipping - use only if signal is <50%)
#   Note: Check signal levels in logs after recording
#   Target: 70-95% of max (no clipping warning)
#   WARNING: Values >1.5x will likely cause distortion with normal speaking
#
# FADE_DURATION_MS - Duration of fade-in/fade-out to eliminate clicks (milliseconds)
#   50 = Default (imperceptible but effective)
#   100 = Longer fade (for stubborn clicks)
#   150 = Very long fade (very aggressive)
#
# VOLUME_STEP - Volume change per rotary encoder step (%)
#   5 = Default (20 steps from 0% to 100%)
#   10 = Larger steps (10 steps from 0% to 100%)
#   1 = Fine control (100 steps from 0% to 100%)
#
# INITIAL_VOLUME - Volume level on startup (%)
#   100 = Default (full volume - recommended)
#   70 = 70% volume
#   50 = Half volume
#   Note: This is the TRUE volume - 100% = full output, not a "ceiling"
#   Note: Rotate encoder anytime to adjust, even during playback!
#
# VERBOSE_OUTPUT - Enable detailed logging output (true/false)
#   true = Default (show all operation details for debugging)
#   false = Minimal output (only show essential messages, better performance)
#   Note: Disabling verbose output can improve responsiveness by 0.5-1 second
