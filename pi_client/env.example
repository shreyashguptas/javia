# GPIO Configuration - Rotary Encoder
BUTTON_PIN=17          # Rotary encoder SW (push button) pin
ROTARY_CLK_PIN=22      # Rotary encoder CLK pin
ROTARY_DT_PIN=23       # Rotary encoder DT pin
AMPLIFIER_SD_PIN=27    # Amplifier shutdown pin

# Audio Configuration
SAMPLE_RATE=48000
CHANNELS=1
CHUNK_SIZE=1024
MICROPHONE_GAIN=2.0
FADE_DURATION_MS=50
BEEP_VOLUME=0.4

# Volume Configuration - Rotary Encoder
VOLUME_STEP=5          # Volume change per encoder step (%)
INITIAL_VOLUME=70      # Initial volume on startup (%)

# Performance Configuration
VERBOSE_OUTPUT=true    # Enable detailed logging (true/false)

# Note: RECORD_SECONDS is not used - recording continues until you press the button again!

# Audio Settings:
# MICROPHONE_GAIN - Amplification factor for recorded audio
#   1.0 = No change (default)
#   2.0 = Double the volume (recommended for quiet recordings)
#   3.0 = Triple the volume (for very quiet microphones)
#   4.0 = Quadruple the volume (may cause distortion)
#
# FADE_DURATION_MS - Duration of fade-in/fade-out to eliminate clicks (milliseconds)
#   50 = Default (imperceptible but effective)
#   100 = Longer fade (for stubborn clicks)
#   150 = Very long fade (very aggressive)
#
# BEEP_VOLUME - Volume level for button feedback beeps (0.0-1.0)
#   0.4 = Default (matches typical TTS output levels)
#   0.3 = Quieter beeps
#   0.5 = Louder beeps
#   0.6 = Maximum recommended (may be too loud)
#   Note: Beeps play when button is pressed (start/stop recording)
#
# VOLUME_STEP - Volume change per rotary encoder step (%)
#   5 = Default (20 steps from 0% to 100%)
#   10 = Larger steps (10 steps from 0% to 100%)
#   1 = Fine control (100 steps from 0% to 100%)
#
# INITIAL_VOLUME - Volume level on startup (%)
#   70 = Default (moderate volume)
#   50 = Half volume
#   100 = Maximum volume
#
# VERBOSE_OUTPUT - Enable detailed logging output (true/false)
#   true = Default (show all operation details for debugging)
#   false = Minimal output (only show essential messages, better performance)
#   Note: Disabling verbose output can improve responsiveness by 0.5-1 second
